          </p>
          <p>
            Litigation is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons
            having a dispute agree to waive their right to file a lawsuit in
            court and to a jury trial, and rather agree to present their dispute
            to a neutral third party (Litigator) for binding decision. You have
            the right to conclude- out of this provision which means that you
            retain your right to file a lawsuit; to do so, you must read
            precisely and follow the directions under the paragraph listed How
            to conclude Out of obligatory Litigation. Unless you conclude Out of
            the obligatory Litigation, you'll be understood to have agreed to
            the obligatory Litigation and the provisions handed below.

            Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND ANY

            RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS HANDED FOR BELOW, FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS
            DEFINED BELOW. THE TERM “DISPUTE” MEANS ANY DISAGREEMENT, CLAIM OR
            CONTESTATION NOW OR IN THE FUTURE BETWEEN YOU AND ADHIBA WHETHER
            GROUNDED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, CONSTITUTION, TORT
            (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT

            PROVISION WOULD APPLY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO conclude- OUT AS bandied
            ABOVE. THE TERM “PRODUCT” INCLUDES THE PHYSICAL PRODUCT BOUGHT AND
            ANY SOFTWARE NECESSARY TO OPERATE THAT PRODUCT. “Dispute” is to be
            given the broadest possible meaning that will be executed.
            Litigation is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Litigation uses
            a neutral, third-person Litigator rather than a judge or jury,
            allows for further limited discovery than in court, and is subject
            to veritably limited review by courts. Litigators can award the same
            damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit
            http//www.iccwbo.org for further information.

            disagreement qualifies for small claims court (there are financial
            limitations for small claims court), or(b) YOU conclude OUT OF THESE
            LITIGATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU Buy OR
            OTHERWISE ACQUIRE THE PRODUCT (the “conclude- Out Deadline”). To
            conclude out of obligatory Litigation, you need to (I) mail written
            notification to Adhiba Private Limited2/153, Padmalaya Nagar,
            Narasimhanaickenpalayam, Tamil Nadu 641031, India, or (II) email

            date of purchase, and (4) a clear statement that you don't wish to
            resolve disputes with ADHIBA through Litigation. Your decision to
            conclude- out of this provision will have no adverse effect on your
            relationship with ADHIBA. Any conclude-out request entered after the
            Opt-Out Deadline won't be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in
